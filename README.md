# Data-scrapping-analysis
Basically i scapped html packets website given below.
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rgs/alice-table.html

i used re, urllib, and BeautifulSoup to download html packets and filter the body 

after filtering the syntax and html tags, i computed which alphabet is repeated most number of times 
I also tried to visualized the data in bar graph form.
